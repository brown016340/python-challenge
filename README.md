# Python-Challenge

This is the python code for the Python Challenge for MSU Data Analytics Bootcamp.

There are two folders that contain files for different applications. The folder ["PyBank"][Link to PyBank] relates to a budget csv that contains dates and values for that date. The python reads the csv and then provides and analysis. This analysis includes total number of months this data runs, the total value, the averagre change in values and then calculates the greatest increase and decrease in profits as well as the date accosiated with it. This information is then saved in a txt file named "analysis"

The other folder, ["PyPoll"][Link to PyPoll] relates to voting information. This code reads the csv, provides the total number of votes cast, each candidate and their vote count with the percentage that vote count was of the whole, and finds the winner of the election. These results are also save to a seperate txt file named "analysis"

Both sets of code are written so that the file path is relative so that this code could run in any machine as long as the same folder structure is kept.
